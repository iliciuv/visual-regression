# Visual-Regression
A tool build with streamlit/Python to create an easy web-application to perform linear regression and show common analysis statistics in an interactive way. The app is prepared to work for 1 regressor and 1 endogenous (like in the context of solar energy production where intensities are regressed on currents and derive power from the obtained proportionality for bias/noise analysis)

## Build notes

This app has been derived from a general production setup combining docker + compose.

## App funcionality

- Estimates a linear model by Max. Likelihood from either random data or a .csv file provided by the user. The web-app calculates and reports live the following elements (by up-down order of apperance):
    - Reports a simplified equation of regression.
    - Graphs its associated scatterplot (left).
    - Reports main model description/statistics (right).
        - Shows an intuitive collection of tips for their interpretation (second tab).
    - Plots obtained residuals (left). 
        - Reports cummulative sum of residuals (second tab).
    - A data.table with overflow shows the three main model series Exogenous Regressor (X), Endogenous Regressor (Y), and regression residuals (Ãª).
        - There is a button allowing the download of these series.


## Live example

There is an instance of the app described in this repository running on a free server of https://share.streamlit.io/
The app could be accessed through the following link (lasat check 17/10/2023):
